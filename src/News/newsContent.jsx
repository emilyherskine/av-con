          "AvCon 2025 – The Future of Aviation & Aerospace, hosted by the Irish Air Corps in collaboration with TYHub.ie, brought together a record-breaking 8,000 students and teachers in person, with thousands more joining via TYHub Live from across Ireland, Northern Ireland, the UK, and Europe — making it the largest aviation and aerospace careers event for students ever held in Ireland. The event, held in the historic Hangar 4 at Casement Aerodrome, has rapidly become a cornerstone in Ireland’s educational and industry calendar. AvCon bridges the gap between classroom learning and real-world careers, offering an unparalleled opportunity for students to explore pathways in aviation, aerospace, space technology, logistics, and engineering. The day opened with a special video address from An Taoiseach Micheál Martin, followed by a welcome from Brigadier General Rory O’Connor, General Officer Commanding the Irish Air Corps. Under the guidance of presenters Ally Garvey and Paul Butler Lennox, the six-hour AvCon Live broadcast featured over 50 national and international speakers and exhibitors, sharing insights from across the global aviation and aerospace community."
