                    Welcome to the next evolution of AvCon.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The AvCon Industry Convention is where innovation meets opportunity - a two-day international event hosted in Ireland, the hub of aviation and aerospace excellence. It’s where leaders, innovators, educators, and emerging talent come together to collaborate, inspire, and shape the future of a rapidly evolving global industry.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Being part of AvCon means more than just attending an event - it means joining a community of likeminded thinkers and doers who believe in action, collaboration, and creating real change. Across both days, the Industry Convention will spark meaningful conversations between sectors - from aviation, aerospace, and space technology to sustainability, defence, logistics, and emerging industries - demonstrating how shared innovation can power a new generation of progress.
                </p>
                <p>
                    AvCon is not only inspiring young minds to pursue their dreams; it’s also inspiring organisations, educators, and industry professionals to think differently, work together, and build the future workforce of tomorrow.
